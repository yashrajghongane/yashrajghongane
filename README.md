## 🧠 About Me

I am focused on building strong foundations in **Machine Learning**, which underpin modern **AI systems**.  
I take a step-by-step approach, prioritizing **logic, problem-solving, and clear understanding** over shortcuts or surface-level knowledge.

I started with **web development fundamentals**, which helped me understand how applications are structured.  
Over time, my focus shifted toward **machine learning, core engineering concepts, and logic-driven development** rather than UI-centric work.
